Create a scanner. Estimated two weeks. The scanner should be turned in on February 7th. The
scanner should only read a text file and write out a sequence of tokens and lexemes, one
pair per line. Note that the scanner will be used in two different compilers, probably with
minor changes in between, such as adding new keywords. I suggest that the language
used for the first compiler be NanoMorpho, as described in markmid.pdf. You will
also want to define the format of comments in your language.
